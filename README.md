Methodology :-
This is a Opencv project with deep learning .  
In deep learning for face recognition i have used deep metric learning where instead of trying to output   
a single label (or even the coordinates/bounding box of objects in an image), i am instead outputting   
a real-valued feature vector that is used to quantify the face.  

Training the network is done using triplets. Here, we need to provide three   
images to the network:   
o Two of these images are example faces of the same person.   
o The third image is a random face from our dataset and is not the same person as the other two images.
